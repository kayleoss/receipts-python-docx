# Receipt Totaler (docx) For Neshama Therapy

> Problem: Neshama Therapy has accumulated thousands of word document RMT and Acupuncture receipts and needs to total them to get income numbers and submit for income tax.



Solution: The script receipts.py works to get all the totals from each doc and add them up, printing the final number into the console. 

Limitations: 
- Each word doc must be exactly the same in terms of format and positioning. 
- Right now, the total is calculated. Future iterations will look to incorporate totals of RMT and Acupuncture separately.

To use this script, you must create a folder in the root directory called "receipts" and place all receipt documents inside it before running the script.
